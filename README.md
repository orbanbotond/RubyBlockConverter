Ruby Block Converter for Sublime Text 2
==============================
A command plugin that enables to toggle ruby blocks between braces and `do end`.

How It Works
--------------
Place the cursor in the block and run the command:

```ruby
# original
foo { bar }

# run "toggle_between_do_end_and_brace"
foo do
  bar
end

# run "toggle_between_do_end_and_brace"
foo { bar }
```

toggle_between_do_end_and_brace shrinks a block in a line when the block traverses at most 3 lines.

```ruby
# original
foo {|a|
  a.bar
}

# run "toggle_between_do_end_and_brace"
foo do |a|
  a.bar
end

# but when revert with "toggle_between_do_end_and_brace",
foo {|a| a.bar }
```

When a block has more than 3 lines, toggle_between_do_end_and_brace leaves those lines untouched.

```ruby
# original
foo do
  bar
  baz
end

# run "toggle_between_do_end_and_brace"
foo {
  bar
  baz
}
```
